# Béton.css

Béton.css is the best CSS framework out there. True story.

Obviously the Interwebs really needed another fucking CSS framework. Well here it is.

Thanks to <http://cssdb.co/> — by @rowanmanning — for pointing out the fact that there are too few CSS frameworks out there.

## Why Use Béton.css?

Because all the framework developers got it wrong, mostly by trying to shave bits off (I call it premature optimization), and because we are tired as front-enders to learn new coding conventions every time we jump to a new project.

Béton.css brings an elegant solution to that problem by bundling as many frameworks as possible together:

- It's filled with the best CSS frameworks out there, so **it's inherently better**.
- It contains multiple versions of Normalize.css and CSS resets so **the browsers won't break your balls** with their stupid default stylesheets.
- **Productivity:** anyone working on your project have at their disposal all the frameworks they are used to and don't have to learn another crazy way to name a button or a grid column.
- With high speed broadband, who cares about another 700KB in our documents? **More code = more awesome.**

And also because Justin Bieber himself uses it in his web projects.

Please note Béton.css weighs 700KB, which ensures that only wealthy users with 4G or broadband Internet will access your content. It obviously maximizes conversion rates and keeps hippies out of your website. For more tips on how to destroy the web, please watch [Bruce Lawson's talk on the subject](https://vimeo.com/32673398).

## Why is it Called  "Béton.css"

In French, *Béton* means *Concrete*. It's fucking solid and robust.

> Good architects build on solid foundations.  
> Amazing architects build on béton.

## License

Do whatever the fuck you want with this piece of software.  
And don't sue me if it breaks your website.

Just respect what the licenses of those frameworks say, or an army of lawyers will knock at your door.
